For those interested in other resources, this is a running list
blogs, articles or talks that have either been foundational in how I think about
data science and software or something that I routinely visit to stay
in touch with where the industry is going and gain perspective on how others
think about machine learning.

I'll try and keep this list short and relevant.

If I had to recommend just one
resource to data scientists who are just getting started it would be
[Google's machine learning guide](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml/).

## Blogs

I'm probably guilty of visiting [Andrew Gelman's blog](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/)
more than any other. Although most of the content is highly specific to Bayesian statistics
I think his perspective on problem solving is relevant to a lot of machine learning.

In no particular order, here are some other blogs I like to follow up on (although some haven't
posted new content in a while).

- [Jake Vanderplaas](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/03/11/frequentism-and-bayesianism-a-practical-intro/)
- [Scott Rome](http://srome.github.io)
- [Colah](https://colah.github.io/)
- [Ruder](https://ruder.io/)
- [Fast AI](https://www.fast.ai/)
- [Michael Betancourt](https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/)
- [Thomas Wiecki](https://twiecki.io/)
- [538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)


## Industry leaders

From time to time I check in on what companies like [Google](https://ai.googleblog.com/),
[DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/blog), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/) and
[Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/) are up to.

## Talks on Machine learning

One of the best intros to deep learning in my opinion: [Sequence to Sequence Deep Learning - Quoc Le](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5RY_SUJih4&feature=youtu.be).

A talk about Netflix's Metaflow: [Human-Centric Machine Learning Infrastructure @Netflix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV5VGddmP24). I'm still not persuaded to personally adopt Metaflow but this is an excellent
overview of the challenges any company will face when trying to grow a data science team.

This talk from PyData NY 2018, [Learning in Cycles: Implementing Sustainable Machine Learning Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiLkaMtzBJQ), gives great guidelines on approaching machine
learning applications without getting boxed in and leaving room for iterations.

## Talks on Software

On software design  and practice [Good Enough is Good Enough - Alex Martelli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ek3A2b-nHU&t=1s)
was an invaluable resource.

Anything by [David Beazely](https://www.youtube.com/user/dabeazllc) is guaranteed to be entertaining and teach
you something new about Python.

[Raymond Hettinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTLu2DFOdTg&list=PLRVdut2KPAguz3xcd22i_o_onnmDKj3MA)'s talks
are great for those new to learning Python.


### Microservices

The following talks were extremely helpful when I first began thinking about deploying
machine learning models behind REST APIs.

- [Microservices at Netflix Scale: Principles, Tradeoffs & Lessons Learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57UK46qfBLY)
- [Microservices at Spotify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LGPeBgNFuU)
- [What I Wish I Had Known Before Scaling Uber to 1000 Services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-m2fasdDY&t=112s)
